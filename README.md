This course project is to demonstrate how to collect, work with and clean data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data taht can be used for later analysis.

The run_analysis.R script will do the following tasks:
1. Merges the training and test data sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Then creates a second in dependent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
